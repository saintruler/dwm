# Simple terminal

Forked from [dwm-v6.2](https://dwm.suckless.org/)

Installed patches:
* [actualfullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/actualfullscreen/) for actual toggling of fullscreen for window
* [focusonclick](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusonclick/) to focus on click (yeah)
* [systray](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/systray/) for simple system tray implementation
* [tilegap](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/tilegap/) for nice gaps between windows
* [statuscmd-signal](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/) for support of clicks on bar in dwmblocks 
  (needed manual merge because of conflict with systray)
* scrollview for scrolling through tags (used with touchpad, for example). Written by me, therefore
  the link to suckless site is missing.
